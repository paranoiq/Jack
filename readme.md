Jack
==========

Jack is a simple client library for **Beanstalk** server written in PHP. it allows to use the complete functionality of Beanstalk server. its task is to provide understandable API and stay as simple as can be.

Beanstalk is a simple, fast work queue server. for more information about Beanstalk see: http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/

Jack is based on a minimalistic client by David Peterson: https://github.com/davidpersson/beanstalk/

Requirements:
----------
**PHP 5.3**, no other libraries needed

if you want to use it in PHP 5.2, just delete the namespace


Usage:
----------
there are two types of client working with a queue. those who insert jobs in queue - *producers*, and those who take jobs from it - *workers*. both of them use the same client class

just instantiate the *Jack\BeanstalkClient* class. if Beanstalk runs on localhost and standard port, there is no need to setup. client will connect automatically when first needed. default settings are: 

    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 11300
    timeout: 1 [s]
    persistent: TRUE

you can specify connection details in constructor


*producer* can open connection and insert a job in 'default' queue this way: 

    $client = new Jack\BeanstalkClient;
    $client->queue("some job data");

*worker* will then assign a job and finish it:

    $client = new Jack\BeanstalkClient;
    $job = $client->assign();
    
    // do something with $job['data']
    
    $client->finish($job['id']);


on errors the client throws *Jack\BeanstalkException*


Job lifecycle
----------

typical job lifecycle:


     queue            assign                finish
    -------> [READY] ---------> [ASSIGNED] --------> *poof*



lifecycle with more possibilities:


    
     queue (+delay)              release (+delay)
    ----------------> [DELAYED] <------------.
                          |                   |
                          | (time passes)     |
                          |                   |
     queue                v     assign        |       finish
    -----------------> [READY] ---------> [ASSIGNED] --------> *poof*
                         ^  ^                |  |
                         |   \  release      |  |
                         |    `-------------'   |
                         |                      |
                         | restore              |
                         |                      |
                         |            suspend   |
                      [SUSPENDED] <-------------'
                         |
                         |  delete
                          `--------> *poof*

Jacks terminology differs from the official protocol in some things. see protocol documentation for more info: https://github.com/kr/beanstalkd/blob/master/doc/protocol.txt


API:
----------

### producer basics:
`self selectQueue(string $queue)` - selects queue in which jobs will be inserted

`self queue(string $data, [int $priority], [int $timeToRun], [int $delay])` - insert a job in the queue


### worker basics:
`self watchQueue(string $queue)` - select queue for requesting jobs. more queues can be watched at a time, but at least one

`self ignoreQueue(string $queue)` - remove the queue from watched

`array assign([int $timeout])` - assign a job from the queue (without timeout will wait if no job is ready). returns `array(int $job, string $data)`

`self finish(int $jobId)` - finish a job. job will be deleted from the queue

`self delete(int $jobId)` - alias for finish

`self touch($jobId)` - will prevent a job from runing out of time. touch will reset the timeToRun clock, so the worker has more time before job is returned back to queue

`self release(int $jobId, [int $priority], [int $delay])` - return an assigned job to the queue (can be assigned by other wotker then)

`self suspend(int $jobId, [int $priority])` - return the job, but prevent it from being assigned again. this can be used in situatins, when a job causes an error and must be investigated before continuing

`int restore(int $number)` - will restore $number suspended jobs. the can be now assigned to worker again

`self pauseQueue(string $queue, int $delay)` - if jobs in a queue cannot be finished (eg. some service is temporarily unavailable), the whole queue can be paused for some time


### investigation:
`array showJob(int $jobId, [bool $stats])` - show a job by its id. returns `array(int $job, string $data, [array $stats])`

`array showNextReadyJob([bool $stats])` - show next ready job. returns as aboveâ€¦

`array showNextDelayedJob([bool $stats])` - show the job with the shortest delay left

`array showNextSuspendedJob([bool $stats])` - show the next job in the list of suspended jobs

`array getJobStats(int $jobId)` - get statistical information about a job

`array getQueueStats(string $queue)` - get statistical information about a queue

`array getServerStats()` - get statistical information about the server

`array getQueues()` - get a list of all server queues

`string getSelectedQueue()` - get name of queue currently selected for inserting jobs

`array getWatchedQueues()` - get list of watched queues


### settings:
`void __construct([$host], [$port], [$timeout], [$persistent])`

`self setDefaultPriority($priority)` - default priority for inserted jobs (default is 1024)

`self setDefaultDelay($delay)` - default delay for inserted jobs in seconds (default is 0)

`self setDefaultTimeToRun($timeToRun)` - default time to run for inserted jobs in seconds (default is 60)

`void quit()` - close connection

### notes:
*$data* can be also other type than string. other types will be automatically serialized on inserting and deserialized on reading

*$delay* can be also a DateTime object representing the time, when job will be ready for assigning

*$priority* is an integer between 0 and 2^32. the lower the priority is the sooner the job will be assigned. priority under 1024 means "urgent"

*$timeToRun* represents maximal time a job can be assigned. after this time the worker is considered to be stuck and job is returned to queue. this can be prevented by "touching" the job
